Cause days are too long but life is so short, cause life is full of possibilities and death is the last choice, I toughly decided that I should be on my own life journey without doubt.

I used to think that I am just an ordinary person, poor in financial condition but rich in spirit. It should be that. But I start to realize that I am far away from an ordinary person and we are far away from ordinary people. We work so hard just to become ordinary.

Sometimes I wonder if it is right to live such a bored life. It is hard and full of sorrows with none to reveal the innermost feelings. In fact, most of the innermost feelings can not be revealed to others. In other words, there do have something which can only be kept in heart.

But still I am not sure what is right and what is wrong. I don't know who formulate the criterion of right or wrong. And god knows whether the criterion is right or not.

Like a fool, I stood under the sunshine watching people come and go. Many went far away and finally were out of my sight. The ones left became close friends. I appreciate them being with me.

At the beginning of this semester, when the day I came back to school, I met my first lover on the bus. We did not talk much, just greeted *Hello* and *Goodbye*, smiling, and walked away like a stranger. Happy ending isn't it? After all, I think so. We are just on each other's path cause everyone has his/her own path. No promise to keep, no happiness to cherish the memory of. And no promise to make and achieve in the future.

Why not to find a new lover? No, I don't want to. I don't want to change my life now. Maybe I just don't want to change the main stream of my daily life for a person who is on the edge of my life. I am not sure of that. I am afraid of changes, afraid that I have to expend a lot then get nothing but sadness and sorrow. To love or not, maybe it is just two kind of lifestyles. And I choose not to.

Many things remain to be done. I have to work hard now and then. Just a moment, let me write down the last sentence. Done!
